# Sales-Analysis-using-Low-code

low-code involves a little coding work. This type of platform can also speed up the delivery of programmers, but it may necessitate some coding work.​

To check the model will work with the fine accuracy or not, most of the programmers uses this platform, to save their time.​

Creating a model in the low-code ML platform has become so far simpler. It needs to import the dataset, structure the data, and then choose any desired low-code platform according to the type of target variable which on result, will output metric reports and validation score.​

Low-code applications are built using a *visual development environment* with tools like drag-and-drop modelers, smart services, components, and pre-built connectors. They reduce the need to write code, and significantly increase the speed at which applications can be built and deployed.​
