## Traditional Machine Learning Approach:

Machine learning is a technique for teaching a machine to predict future outcomes​

In the traditional machine learning approach, a model must be trained using the most appropriate algorithm on the type of data. ​

So, the provided unstructured data had to processed in every process step for data cleaning and then for feature engineering and at last for model creation and Evaluation​

If the accuracy is not up to the mark, then the next step is hyperparameter tunning process to get the good accuracy of the model.​

## Challenges in Traditional ML Approach:

It had to go through every step of machine learning. By evaluating the model, if the accuracy/results of model are not sober then one has to repeat the process from creating the model again or from data preprocessing process and this will repeat unless and until a fine accuracy is not achieved. So, steps involvements is a first challenge​

During this repetitive process, a lot of time gets consumed while selecting a best model. Also, the deployment process requires time to get the program coded according to the desired Interface of the user. So, the second concern is about the time consumption.​

Every stage involves a solid understanding of programming and statistics. The problem is that not all statistics specialists are programmers, and not all programmers are statisticians. So, the third concern is about the statics and programming knowledge.​


#### To overcome this challenges, no-code/low-code platforms were introduced.​


low-code involves a little coding work. This type of platform can also speed up the delivery of programmers, but it may necessitate some coding work.​

To check the model will work with the fine accuracy or not, most of the programmers uses this platform, to save their time.​

Creating a model in the low-code ML platform has become so far simpler. It needs to import the dataset, structure the data, and then choose any desired low-code platform according to the type of target variable which on result, will output metric reports and validation score.​

Low-code applications are built using a *visual development environment* with tools like drag-and-drop modelers, smart services, components, and pre-built connectors. They reduce the need to write code, and significantly increase the speed at which applications can be built and deployed.​
